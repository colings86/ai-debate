  "outcome_reason": "An exceptionally high-quality, tightly contested debate. The Promoter won the empirical, present-tense trajectory argument with measurable data on AI code volume, PR explosion, collapsing junior pipeline, and structural feedback loops. The Detractor won the philosophical and definitional argument: the creative act was always the design decision, not code-writing; the Promoter expanded 'review' to encompass all professional judgment, emptying the word of meaning; and historical precedent (Solow paradox, compiler revolution) predicts diversification, not narrowing. Both conceded key points, narrowing the gap to a draw.",
